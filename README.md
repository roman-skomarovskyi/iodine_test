# Cypress test task for Iodine
- This project is created to demonstrate abilities (magic ones) to work with Cypress 'corner cases' scenarios (e.g. iframes, several tabs, hover event, browsers field verification). 
---
# Requirements
- yarn version v1.22.19
---
# Start working
- To install all the needed dependencies run:
```
yarn
```
---
## Run tests
- For windowed mode:
```
yarn test:open
```
- For headless mode:
```
yarn test:run
```
---
## Common issues/troubleshooting
- Final assertion of current test - verification of the error message generated by browser. Message text may vary on browser under the tests and/or current user location. Current implementation is adjusted for default Cypress browser - electron.
- In case if another browser is used as a main - go to locators [module](./cypress/support/locators/careerPage.js) and change the error message to appropriate one:
```
FILL_REQUIRED: 'Please fill in this field.'
```
- Test might fail if internet connection is too slow, could be fixed by increasing timeouts or retries count
---
## TODOs/Future plans:
- Cross browser adaptation (see Common issues/troubleshooting)
- Make some methods more 'generalistic'. As current implementation was adapted for the specific use case
- Add code style verification (e.g. lint)
- Probably add dotenvs support (setting specific timeouts, etc.)
- Add more comments/JSDoc
- Test on CI/other environments to adjust timeouts and retries
